## Getting Started

Add **`flutter_contacts_service`** to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_contacts_service: ^0.1.0
```

### Platform Specific Setup

#### Android

Android is Handled by the plugin.

#### iOS

Add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires contacts access to function properly.</string>
```

and if you are using Permission Handler: (dont forget to add this to your Podfile)

```ruby
    config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
     '$(inherited)',
     'PERMISSION_CONTACTS=1',
    ]
```

## Usage

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:flutter_contacts_service/flutter_contacts_service.dart';
```

### Basic Operations

```dart
// Get all contacts
List<ContactInfo> contacts = await FlutterContactsService.getContacts();

// Get contacts without thumbnails (faster)
List<ContactInfo> contacts = await FlutterContactsService.getContacts(
  withThumbnails: false
);

// Get contacts by query
List<ContactInfo> contacts = await FlutterContactsService.getContacts(
  query: "John"
);

// Get contacts by phone number
List<ContactInfo> contacts = await FlutterContactsService.getContactsForPhone(
  phone: "+1234567890"
);

// Get contacts by email
List<ContactInfo> contacts = await FlutterContactsService.getContactsForEmail(
  email: "example@email.com"
);

// Get avatar for a contact
Uint8List avatar = await FlutterContactsService.getAvatar(
  contact,
  photoHighResolution: true
);
```

### Contact Management

```dart
// Add a new contact
ContactInfo newContact = ContactInfo(
  givenName: "John",
  familyName: "Doe",
  phones: [Item(label: "mobile", value: "+1234567890")],
  emails: [Item(label: "work", value: "john.doe@company.com")]
);
await FlutterContactsService.addContact(newContact);

// Update a contact
contact.familyName = "Smith";
await FlutterContactsService.updateContact(contact);

// Delete a contact
await FlutterContactsService.deleteContact(contact);
```

### Native UI Integration

```dart
// Open native contact form
await FlutterContactsService.openContactForm();

// Open existing contact in native UI
await FlutterContactsService.openExistingContact(contact);

// Open device contact picker
await FlutterContactsService.openDeviceContactPicker();
```

## Contact Model

```dart
class ContactInfo {
  String? identifier;
  String? displayName;
  String? givenName;
  String? middleName;
  String? familyName;
  String? prefix;
  String? suffix;
  String? company;
  String? jobTitle;
  String? note;
  String? birthday;
  List<ValueItem> emails;
  List<ValueItem> phones;
  List<PostalAddress> postalAddresses;
  Uint8List? avatar;
}
```

## Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling and will throw specific exceptions for common error cases:

```dart
try {
  await FlutterContactsService.addContact(contact);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error adding contact: $e');
}
```

## Additional Notes

- This plugin does not handle permission requesting. Use plugins like `permission_handler` to manage contact permissions.
- Contact avatars are loaded lazily by default to improve performance.
- The plugin supports both Android and iOS native contact forms.
